As technology continues to advance, the prevalence of cyber security risks has become more pronounced. The digital landscape provides ample opportunities for malicious actors to exploit vulnerabilities in various systems by ways of phishing attacks, ransomware, social engineering tactics, and detection evading automated programs and scripts. Machine learning provides an invaluable role in risk management and can fortify threat detection mechanisms to identify and prevent fradulent activities, and maintaining the integrity of systems and transactions.

However, finding the right balance between robust anomaly detection and user convenience is a chllenging task for organizations, and machine learning models tend to perform well on the majority class, leading to potential oversight of minority class instances such as rare anomaly cases. In this tutorial, we will explore the predictive strengths of several machine learning techniques such as Random Forest, AdaBoost, CatBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM, on both the majority and minority class, and compare techniques to address the class imbalance issue using oversampling (E.g., SMOTE, ADASYN) and stratified sampling (E.g., Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation) techniques.
